    <h2>What is it?</h2>
    <p>Birdwatching, or birding, is the observing of birds, either as a recreational activity or as a form of citizen science. A birdwatcher may observe by using their naked eye, by using a visual enhancement device such as binoculars or a telescope, by listening for bird sounds, watching public webcams, or by viewing smart bird feeder cameras. The hobby of studying wild birds in their natural environment.</p></div>

    <p>The facts are there: humans are meant to live in harmony with nature. We know this intuitively, yet many choose to forget it. In paved worlds of cities and cars, where roofs shelter us, climate control pampers us and windows separate us, we often look on nature as something remote, distant, strange. Something to be planned for and squeezed into one or two weekends a year. Maybe some wouldn't know what to do in nature when they got there! Birding gives us an excuse to go outside and just be, listening, observing, feeling.</p>

    <h3>How to Choose Birdwatching Binoculars for Beginners?</h3>
